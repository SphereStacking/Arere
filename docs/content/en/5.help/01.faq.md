# FAQ

A collection of frequently asked questions and answers.

## General Questions

### What is arere?

arere is a TypeScript-based persistent terminal launcher. You can define frequently used commands and scripts as "actions" and execute them interactively.

### What use cases is it suited for?

- Streamlining development workflows (Git operations, deployments, etc.)
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Sharing scripts within teams (distributed as plugins)
- Use in CI/CD pipelines

### What are the system requirements?

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm 9.0.0 or higher
- macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL recommended)

## Installation

### What's the difference between global and local installation?

**Global installation** (recommended):
```bash
npm install -g arere
```
You can run the `arere` command from any directory.

**Local installation**:
```bash
npm install arere
```
Can only be used within the project, run with `npx arere`.

### Can I run it with npx every time?

Yes, but it will be slow because the package downloads each time. For frequent use, global installation is recommended.

## About Actions

### Where should I place actions?

- **Global actions**: `~/.arere/` - Available in all projects
- **Project-specific**: `./.arere/` - Only available in that project

### Can I write actions in languages other than TypeScript?

Currently only TypeScript is supported. Actions are automatically transpiled at runtime.

### Is the action name required?

No, it's not required. If omitted, it's automatically inferred from the filename.

```typescript
// ~/.arere/hello-world.ts
export default defineAction({
  // name: 'hello-world' is automatically set
  description: 'Hello World',
  async run() { ... }
})
```

### How do I write tests for actions?

You can use regular TypeScript/JavaScript test frameworks (Jest, Vitest, etc.).

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import action from '../actions/hello'

describe('hello action', () => {
  it('should have correct name', () => {
    expect(action.name).toBe('hello')
  })
})
```

---

## About Plugins

### What's the plugin naming convention?

Plugin names must start with `arere-plugin-`.

- ✅ `arere-plugin-git`
- ✅ `arere-plugin-docker`
- ❌ `git-plugin`

### Can I use a plugin without publishing it?

Yes. You can link it locally using `npm link`:

```bash
cd arere-plugin-my-plugin
npm run build
npm link

# In the project where you want to use it
npm link arere-plugin-my-plugin
```

### How do I manage plugin dependencies?

Specify plugin-specific dependencies in `dependencies` and arere itself in `peerDependencies`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "date-fns": "^2.30.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "arere": ">=0.1.0"
  }
}
```

---

## About CI/CD

### Can I use it in CI/CD environments?

Yes. You can run in headless mode (no UI) with `arere run <action>`.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- run: npx arere run deploy
```

### How do I pass environment variables?

You can access them from the `env` object in actions:

```typescript
export default defineAction({
  async run({ env }) {
    const apiKey = env.API_KEY
    // ...
  }
})
```

---

## About Internationalization

### Which languages are supported?

Currently English (en) and Japanese (ja) are supported.

### How do I switch languages?

You can specify the language with the `LANG` environment variable or in the config file.

### How do I add translations for plugins?

Create a `locales/` folder in the plugin directory and place translation files for each language:

```
locales/
├── en/translation.json
└── ja/translation.json
```

See [Plugin Configuration](/en/guides/plugins/config) for details.

### Where are logs stored?

Logs are not stored by default. If you need debugging, set the `DEBUG=arere*` environment variable.

### How do I clear the cache?

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/arere
```

### How do I report bugs?
