# What are Actions

Actions are units of tasks that can be executed in arere. Written in TypeScript, you select and execute them with fuzzy search.

## Action Locations

Actions can be placed in two locations:

### Global Actions

Actions available across all projects:

```
~/.arere/actions/
├── git-commit.ts
├── git-switch.ts
└── docker-compose.ts
```

### Project-Specific Actions

Actions used only in a specific project:

```
~/my-project/.arere/actions/
├── deploy.ts
└── test-e2e.ts
```

When you run `arere` in a project directory, both global and project actions are displayed.

## Loading Priority

When actions have the same name, the one loaded later takes precedence (Last-Wins):

1. **Plugin actions** (highest priority)
2. **Global actions**
3. **Project actions** (lowest priority)
